# 6 Estimating the probabilities of hypotheses in the light of more
# and more evidence
# Write a program that simulates the cast of an unknown die, chosen from a set of 5 dice with 4, 6,
# 8, 12, and 20 faces. To start with, every die has a probability of 0.2 to be the chosen die. At every
# cast, the probability of each die being the chosen die is updated using Bayesâ€™ rule (find out about
# it if you do not know it). The probabilities are displayed for at most 5 casts. If more than 5 casts
# have been requested, the final probabilities obtained for the chosen number of casts are eventually
# displayed.
